# Calculator
 Hidden Messaging iOS app disguised as a calculator

## Set-Up
Create a new project in Google Firebase and follow the instructions on setting up the iOS SDK within the app. Make sure the `GoogleServices-Info.plist` file is in the Calculator App folder. You may also require a Cloud Messaging Server Key to allow notifications to be sent. This key will be added in `Notifications.swift`. You will have to set up push notifications like you normally would (request Push Certificates and upload APNs Authentication Keys to Firebase).

That's it that's all!
